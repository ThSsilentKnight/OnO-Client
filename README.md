Dev Log

Days 1–3:
Set up the project structure, organized files, and did some basic prototyping to get everything running.

Day 4:
Focused on defining the Tic Tac Toe core concept and experimented with drag-and-drop mechanics.

Day 5:
Decided to drop the drag-and-drop mechanic for now and instead worked on implementing win detection for the base game.

Day 6:
Spent the day figuring out server–client connections. Built a simple prototype; next step is integrating multiplayer into the base game.

Day 7:
Connected MongoDB and created a test database to learn how databases work. Also did some general project reorganization.

Day 8:
Added a basic navbar (still a work in progress). Improved my CSS skills by experimenting a lot and seeing what works. Added borders to divs to better visualize layout structure.

Day 9:
Light day — mostly experimenting with UI ideas.

Day 10:
Played around with message sending between clients.

Day 11:
Cleaned up code and implemented a way to broadcast messages to everyone in a specific game.

Day 12:
Rooms are now fully connected, with updates syncing correctly on both the client and server sides.

Day 13:
70% of the otrio game concept is done, swaped server to typescript. when reloading, colors save, the whole board will be regenerated. cleaned up the tic tac toe game, and readjusted the server backend

day 14: added some ui elements, and working on the win detections for all possible win patterns

day 15: played with some ui, and finished win patterns. deploying to railway for testing.
